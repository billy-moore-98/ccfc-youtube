There was so much talk about our previous meetings I think it worked against you and for us. I also thought LeBris' tactics were spot on. I do feel confident we will get over the line but if I were a Coventry fan I would take hope in the fact todays result is proof that what everyone assumes is going to happen often doesn't.","Sunderand fan here, enjoy your channel, discovered it halfway through the season, have watched it since.

33,"I'm a Sunderland fan, and must say, the summaries were both fair & very good.
As Sophie mentioned, Coventry had the majority of possession, though they just didn't create enough clear cut chances.
We executed our game plan, perfectly, & took the chances that came our way.
More pleasing for me, is the togetherness, heart, desire, belief and the will to win, shown by The Lads, after being in a downward slump, playing slow, dull, uncreative football, for the best part of the last 6 months.
The tie is by no means over just yet, and undoubtedly, there'll be a few twists & turns, to come on Tuesday, night, where we'll have 46-47,000 inside the SOL, but regardless of  whatever happens then, Sunderland players have rediscovered & regained, their pride & their passion, with that gutsy, win at Coventry.

96,"Two Coventry fans, I think are alright. As a Sunderland fan I'm happy with the result. Totally unpredictable, that's the beauty of football. All still to play for but we have to use this result as motivation. The fans on Tuesday need to find the old Roker roar and get us over the line.","Two Coventry fans, I think are alright.

97,As a Sunderland supporter I had a good feeling about this game: partly due to none of the four sides being in great form at the moment . I felt we were mentally tougher and more disciplined than Coventry on the night! However it’s only half time and Coventry certainly have the players the turn it around! Great confidence booster for Isidor which will certainly help us. Plus we hopefully will have Mundle back for the second leg!However one thing to come out of this is the old adage : the only predictable thing about football is its unpredictability! Can still go either way though!,As a Sunderland supporter I had a good feeling about this game: partly due to none of the four sides being in great form at the moment .

99,"Sunderland fan here, it's only half time, still have a massive job to do at home. Time and time again form goes out the window when it comes to these play off games. It takes two to make a great match, well played Coventry but Ha'way The Lads.","Sunderland fan here, it&#39;s only half time, still have a massive job to do at home.
